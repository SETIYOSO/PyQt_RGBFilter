# PyQt_RGBFilter
OpenCV RGB Filter implemented with PyQt4

I create this simple project to help me locate threshold value used to filter image based on RGB value.
Also it's a great way to learn Python and openCV at the same time.
QT is used because it has prettier interface than standard openCV GUI.

Usage:
======
- Run the program
- Choose which image to process and then change slider value to see it's effect.

Note:
=====
- I believe there's a lot of room for improvement. Feel free to contribute.


Components:
===========
- python 2.7
- Qt4 (and it's python binding)
- OpenCV 3.1.0
- Ubuntu 16.10
